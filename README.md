Abstract:
Ransomware attacks have become a significant threat to individuals and organizations worldwide. In this project, we aim to comprehensively study the lifecycle of ransomware attacks and develop effective mitigation strategies. By simulating various attack scenarios and implementing detection and recovery mechanisms, we seek to enhance understanding and defense against ransomware threats.

Phases Overview:
Phase 1: Ransomware Development
Description: Developed a custom ransomware prototype capable of encrypting files securely.
Implementation: Implemented encryption functions using Python cryptography libraries.
Outcome: Successfully created a functional ransomware script capable of encrypting files within a specified directory.
Phase 2: Deployment and Infection
Description: Simulated ransomware deployment through various infection vectors, including phishing emails and compromised USB drives.
Implementation: Conducted deployment simulations to observe ransomware spread in a controlled environment.
Outcome: Obtained insights into how ransomware propagates through different infection vectors and affects target systems.
Phase 3: Monitoring and Detection
Description: Implemented robust monitoring systems to detect ransomware activities in real-time.
Implementation: Utilized the watchdog library for file system monitoring and anomaly detection.
Outcome: Developed effective detection mechanisms to identify ransomware activities promptly and minimize false positives.
Phase 4: Mitigation and Recovery
Description: Developed mitigation and recovery procedures to contain ransomware attacks and restore affected systems.
Implementation: Automated response mechanisms triggered by ransomware detection alerts.
Outcome: Successfully contained ransomware attacks and restored affected systems to a secure state using automated recovery procedures.
Phase 5: Investigation and Analysis
Description: Conducted a detailed investigation of ransomware behaviors and attack patterns.
Implementation: Analyzed detection and mitigation strategies to improve defense mechanisms.
Outcome: Gained insights into ransomware operation processes and identified areas for improving detection and mitigation techniques.
Phase 6: Report and Documentation
Description: Compiled comprehensive reports detailing the project's methodology, findings, and recommendations.
Implementation: Prepared README files summarizing each phase and providing relevant code snippets.
Outcome: Documented project findings and provided recommendations for enhancing cybersecurity resilience against ransomware threats.
Conclusion:
Through the systematic exploration of ransomware attack lifecycles and countermeasures, the project contributes to enhancing cybersecurity awareness and resilience. By understanding the intricacies of ransomware behavior and implementing effective defense mechanisms, we aim to mitigate the impact of cyber threats on individuals and organizations.
